==================

A college project as a part of completion of a course in Python Application Programming

This is an application which aims to crawl and obtain extensive data about various matches played in the Indian Premier League. The development process can be divided into three modules.

1. Building a framework to crawl the given family of URLs and get on the local system the .html pages from which data can be extracted. (Web Programming, urllib and urllib2)
        http://www.iplt20league.com/ipl_6/results.html

2. Extracting data in a desired format for storage. (Regular Expressions, String Matching)
3. Creating and populating a local database with all the data extracted which can be used for querying in the future. (Databases)

Of course, the mode of interfacing will be GUI.
